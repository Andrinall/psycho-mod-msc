I always thought that My Summer Car was perfect for adding more creepy and disturbing content. And we did it!

A new "PSYCHO" need bar has been added, which is responsible for the character's sanity. Psycho can be replenished with various anti-social actions - the middle finger and urine on Teimo, breaking glass, stealing a poker machine, fighting (but not with a watch-man), etc.

Psycho will gradually decrease and when it reaches zero, the character will go crazy. But that's not the end!

After that, the world around you will change and will look and sound scary, and Psycho will start to increase. If Psycho reaches 100%, the character will die of a heart attack.

To prevent this, after getting into the psycho-world, you need to urgently take pills (you will have ~20 minutes of real time). But here's the problem - you can't just buy the pills, because they haven't been produced for a long time. But your family doctor is ready to help! He will leave the medicine for you in secluded places, and you will find a photo of the place in your mailbox every time you get to the psycho-world.

Did you recognize the place in the photo? Did you manage to get there? Take the pills - and now you are back in the normal world.

Psycho affects your sleep - the less Psycho remains, the worse you sleep. Coffee can become your friend!

In addition, a through storyline has been added to the game. In the living room, you can find a character's diary, but the pages have disappeared. They were stolen by a strange creature, a figurine of which used to stand on the shelf of the closet.

To return the pages - go to the island and play Tarot cards. If you are lucky and you win, the creature will return one of the diary pages. But keep in mind, the entry may be false! It's up to you to decide if what's written on the page is true or not, and if you want to believe it or not!
Got a page? Go home, bring it to your diary and use it! The page is glued in and becomes part of the character's story. Collect all 13 lost pages and learn about his dark past!

And that's it? Well, of course not! We couldn't create a horror mod without adding a little magic to it. Have you seen the sketchbook on the table in the living room? And the newspaper in Teimo's shop? All this for a reason! There is now a witch's pentagram on the ground floor of the abandoned house. Bring five special magic items here, activate the pentagram and receive a reward from Satana. Or a curse. It depends on your luck. It could be a useful game item, money, filling your bugs with fuel, or maybe something bad, who knows?

Magic items appear in certain places on a certain day of the week. I won't tell you where to look for them - there are hints in the album. But if it so happened that you didn't have time or forgot to find one or more items, then don't be sad. When you get to the psycho-world, just find your cousin. You can buy the missing items from him for only 500mk. But remember, this won't work in the normal world!

And remember - bad people go to hell! Behave well, help the residents of Alivieska, don't break the law, don't drink too much and sooner or later you will see the good ending of this story! Or plunge into all the hardships, be a bad guy and bring yourself to a sad end! Everything is in your hands, and grandma will look after you from the photo that is on the kitchen table. The closer grandma is - the closer you are to the bad ending.

Also, screamers have been added to the mod, from time to time UNEXPECTEDLY popping up on the screen. If you don't like this, then just disable this function in the mod settings.
